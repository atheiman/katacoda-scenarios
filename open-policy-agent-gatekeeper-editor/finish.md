**Thank you for attending our workshop!**

You've successfully deployed a few basic Kubernetes cluster policies using OPA Gatekeeper and hopefully you can see how these examples can be extended to real life challenges cluster administrators have to solve for. OPA Gatekeeper is a new and actively developed project that makes implementing these Kubernetes cluster policies easier.

Feel free to share this Katacoda course with others!
